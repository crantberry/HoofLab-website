        <h2>Katrina Forrest, Research Scientist 3</h2>
        <p>Kat Forrest's research journey began while she was an undergraduate at UCSD, where her microbiology coursework led to research on secondary metabolism and marine natural product chemistry. Thanks to a series of fortunate events, she was trained on how to operate the lab’s mass spectrometer and it’s been love ever since ❤. This new knowledge led to a project using molecular networking techniques to visualize and identify changes in the secreted secondary metabolome of a marine microbe in response to different environmental stressors. <br> Following graduation, Kat joined the metabolomics team at a synthetic biology company where she created new high-throughput small molecule assays to help support protein engineering efforts. When she joined Hoofnagle Laboratory in 2020, this experience was utilized to streamline existing assays and data analysis pipelines. Kat has since shifted her focus away from small molecules and has joined the wonderful and wacky world of proteomics, which has motivated her to obtain a master's degree with the Hoofnagle Laboratory. </p>
